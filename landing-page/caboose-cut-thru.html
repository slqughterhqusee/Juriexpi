            T-Rexes and trains? There&rsquo;s no better way to keep your kids happy. The train begins at 7:00AM, giving
            early Caboose Cut-thru buyers an exclusive truck tour before everyone else. Each ride lasts 25 minutes, with
            15 minute intervals in between. This special ride allows you not only to have a family-fun experience, but
            also to view the T-Rex from above. You may even get to see it bring food back to its den!
