                <p>The Expeditions branch consists of engineers and designers who are utterly inspired by John
                    Hammond's
                    mision to recreate the Old World. Our goal is to present the park in a way that you, our loyal
                    customer,
                    can wholeheartedly enjoy without regret or a dull moment.
                    <br><br>
                    The Expeditions branch has been at work since around halfway through Jurassic Park's original
                    production. We have countless ideas and drafts of your current spectacles and an overflowing
                    pool of
                    ideas to continue producing the best experience possible for you! If you see our Expeditions
                    designers
                    around the park, feel free to give them your love and appreciation for the wonderful place you
                    stand
                    in
                    today!

He is wearing a khaki button up and a black tie, which is cinched up top by an orange ring. Carl is a shorter, masculine looking person who is slightly below average height. He has short light brown hair, and is wearing a black button up and grey tie with a black jacket on top.">
                <p>Our designers don't just sit in the office! They curate every expedition in person.
                    Both of them assist our engineers on field!</p>
