            <p>The Expeditions branch consists of engineers and designers who are utterly inspired by John Hammond's
                mision to recreate the Old World. Our goal is to present the park in a way that you, our loyal customer,
                can wholeheartedly enjoy without regret or a dull moment.
                <br>
                The Expeditions branch has been at work since around halfway through Jurassic Park's original
                production. We have countless ideas and drafts of your current spectacles and an overflowing pool of
                ideas to continue producing the best experience possible for you! If you see our Expeditions designers
                around the park, feel free to give them your love and appreciation for the wonderful place you stand in
                today!

He is wearing a khaki button up and a black tie, which is cinched up top by an orange ring. Carl is a shorter, masculine looking person who is slightly below average height. He has short light brown hair, and is wearing a black button up and grey tie with a black jacket on top.">
