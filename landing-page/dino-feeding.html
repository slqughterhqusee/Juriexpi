            And for parents&mdash;no worries! Your kids are safe. These silly little dinos aren&rsquo;t very big, and

            Participants and their chaperons should meet at the stand in the Pterodactyl Dome. Depending on how big each
            party is, our staff members will take you to the Microceratus or Triceratops exhibits. Our exhibit staff
            will section off an area for the dinosaurs to be fed. Each feeder will be given a handful of hay to feed the
            dinosaurs.
