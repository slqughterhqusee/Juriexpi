            Each tour is 2-3 hours long with 15-20 minute intervals in between for cleaning. Tours are uniquely timed each day. For information on what times tours are taking place, check your itinerary with the available park times during your stay with us at Jurassic Park. The tour will be accompanied with dinosaur facts by Richard Kiley.
