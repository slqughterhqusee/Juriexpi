            Each tour is 2-3 hours long with 15-20 minute intervals in between for cleaning. Tours are uniquely timed
            each day. For information on what times tours are taking place, check your itinerary with the available park
            times during your stay with us at Jurassic Park. The tour will be accompanied with dinosaur facts by Richard
            Kiley.
