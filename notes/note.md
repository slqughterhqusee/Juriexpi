    What i need to go over w fast:
    -shopping cart (& how to make the selections appear in my corresponding pages)
        ^said he'd manage
    -how to have the inputted payment info repeated on the confirmation page
        ^ too hard, just ignore semantic confirmation
    -itinerary....

    TO DO:
    -insert links + titles
    -add classes to everything
    -ask fast about how to add the pop-up scheds to the itinerary
    ^ add html, use css to display:none, then use js for appearance based on click
