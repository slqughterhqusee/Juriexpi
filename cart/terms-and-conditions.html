            <li>Assumption of Risk: <br>
                Visitors to Jurassic Park hereby acknowledge and fully comprehend that this park presents inherent risks
                and
                challenges. These may include, but are not limited to, the presence of live dinosaurs, the ever-evolving
                and
                potentially hazardous conditions, various physical aspects of the park, and environmental factors.
                Visitors
                hereby assume all associated risks, which may include personal injury or, in the most extreme cases, the
                unfortunate loss of life. In recognizing these risks, visitors commit to understanding and respecting
                the
                essential safety measures in place.
            </li>
            <li>
                Age Restrictions: <br>
                In order to ensure the safety and well-being of all visitors, those under the age of 18 must be
                accompanied
                by a legal guardian or parent. The guardian or parent assumes full responsibility for the minor's safety
                and
                well-being during their visit. It is highly recommended that children under the age of 5 do not attend
                due
                to the nature of the park. Parents and guardians are encouraged to exercise due diligence in assessing
                whether the park is suitable for their child's age and disposition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Entry Requirements: <br>
                Upon entering Jurassic Park, all visitors are required to sign a comprehensive liability waiver,
                acknowledging the associated risks and responsibilities that come with their visit. Furthermore, a valid
                government-issued photo ID and proof of current medical insurance coverage must be presented as a
                condition
                of entry. The responsibility for presenting these documents lies with the visitor, and failure to
                provide
                them may result in entry refusal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prohibited Items: <br>
                In the interest of the safety and comfort of all visitors and the preservation of the park, the
                following
                items are strictly prohibited within the confines of Jurassic Park:
                <ul>
                    <li>Firearms, explosives, or any weapons of any kind. This prohibition includes but is not limited
                        to
                        firearms, ammunition, knives, or any other tools that may be considered dangerous.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drones, remote-controlled devices, or any other remote-operated equipment. These devices may
                        disrupt the
                        park's tranquil environment and pose safety risks to both visitors and the park's inhabitants.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Food, beverages, or coolers. On-site dining facilities are available for your convenience,
                        offering a
                        range of culinary delights that will ensure a pleasant and satisfying dining experience during
                        your
                        visit.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Glass containers of any kind. The presence of glass containers poses a danger to both visitors
                        and the
                        park's inhabitants, as it may result in shattered glass and potential harm to animals and park
                        staff.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Laser pointers, or any other objects that may disturb the animals or other guests. Such objects
                        may
                        cause distress to the park's inhabitants and disrupt the tranquility of the park.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balloons, as they may pose a danger to the dinosaurs and other guests, and can adversely affect
                        the
                        park's ecosystem. The release of balloons can result in unnecessary litter and potential hazards
                        to both
                        wildlife and visitors.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Park Etiquette: <br>
                We kindly request that all visitors adhere to the following etiquette guidelines, as they are integral
                to
                ensuring the safety and comfort of all park guests:
                <ul>
                    <li>Refrain from feeding the dinosaurs, as this could disrupt their natural behaviors and
                        potentially pose
                        risks to both the dinosaurs and visitors. Feeding dinosaurs is strictly prohibited, as it can
                        lead to
                        altered dietary habits and potentially harmful interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not attempt to touch, tap on, or otherwise interact with the enclosures or the dinosaurs.
                        It's
                        essential to remember that these are wild creatures in a controlled environment. Interacting
                        with the
                        dinosaurs may cause stress or provoke defensive responses.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid littering or defacing any park property, as it goes against our commitment to
                        environmental
                        conservation and the preservation of the park's natural beauty. Proper disposal of trash is
                        essential
                        for maintaining the park's integrity.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flash photography and loud noises are to be avoided, as they may distress the animals and other
                        visitors. Please be mindful of the natural environment and the peace and tranquility it
                        provides.
                        Disruptive behavior may result in immediate eviction from the park without a refund.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a minimum distance of 20 feet from all dinosaurs at all times, except when guided by
                        park staff
                        during designated interactive experiences. This rule is designed to ensure the safety and
                        comfort of
                        both visitors and the dinosaurs. Approaching dinosaurs too closely may provoke defensive
                        behaviors,
                        posing risks to both visitors and the animals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Emergency Procedures: <br>
                While emergencies are rare, it is crucial for visitors to understand the procedures in place in case of
                such an event. In the unlikely event of an emergency, please follow the instructions provided by park
                staff and use the designated emergency exits. It is essential to note that Jurassic Park cannot be held
                responsible for any injuries or damages incurred during emergency situations. Visitors are strongly
                encouraged to familiarize themselves with the park's emergency procedures, including the locations of
                emergency exits and first aid stations, upon arrival.

                visitor safety. In the event of a park closure, no refunds or rain checks will be provided. Visitors are
                strongly encouraged to check the weather forecast before planning their visit and come prepared for any

                of the visitor.

                items that are found will be retained for a period of 30 days, and we will make reasonable efforts to

                prior notice. In the event of a park closure, no refunds or rain checks will be provided. While we
                strive to minimize such closures, they may be necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of our
                visitors and the animals. Visitors are encouraged to check the park's official website or contact park

                park itself is strictly prohibited. Visitors should treat fellow guests and staff with respect and
                kindness, creating a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for all.
            </li>
